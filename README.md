## Project Overview

This Project is part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program in collaboration with <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/" target="_blank">Figure Eight</a>. In this project I will apply data engineering to analize disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API to classify disaster messages.. 

The data contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. The objective if to create a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

Once the model is ready, we will be displaying the result in a Flask Web app, such that anyone should be able to input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
